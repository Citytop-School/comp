<h1><u>Paul's early life</u></h1>
<p>
    Paul was a great apostle of God but before
    then his name was Saul.
</p>
<p>
    He was born in Tarsus,a city in Cilicia
</p>
<p>
    Paul was a Jew but he was born in a Roman
    territory so he was both Hebrew and a Roman
    citizen.
</p>
<p>
    He was the son of a Pharisee later he became
    a lawyer in Jewish laws and studied under the
    famous teacher Gamaliel.
</p>
<p>
    Gamaliel was a Pharisee,a great teacher of all Jewish
    laws and was well respected by many.
</p>
<p>
    Paul's religion was Judaism [follower of the Jewish laws].
</p>
<p>
    Before his encounters with God Saul persecuted Christians,arrested
    many and killed some.
</p>
<p>
    He entered into every house and arrested men and women in the Early
    Church.
</p>
<p>
    He saw Jesus as a deceiver and Christianity as a threat to Judaism.
</p>
<p>
    This made him hate Christians and he was determined to destroy
    christianity altogether.
