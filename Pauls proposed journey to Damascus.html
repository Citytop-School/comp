<h1><u>Paul's proposed journey to Damascus</u></h1>
<p>
    The Jewish leaders did not believe what the Christians
    taught and called the teachings blasphemy.
</p>
<p>
    Blasphemy is a teaching against God.
</p>
<p>
    However,more people believed in Jesus and this made the Jewish
    leaders afraid.
</p>
<p>
    Paul was not happy that christianity was fast growing and the
    miracles that were happening.
</p>
<p>
    So he sent a letter to the synagogue (Jewish place of worship) in Damascus
    and informed them that he was coming to arrest people who mentioned the
    name of Jesus and will be sent to jails in Jerusalem.
